Extracting terms:
{-# EXTRACT agda-name haskell-name #-}
haskell-type is inferred
It should also be able to extract constructors but doesn't right now.

Extracting opaque types:
{-# EXTRACT agda-type haskell-type #-}
newtype haskell-type a0 a1 a2 = haskell-type (forall b0 b1. agda-type-in-compiler b0 b1)

Extracting datatypes:
{-# EXTRACT_DATA agda-type haskell-type haskell-cons1 haskell-cons2 ... #-}
Does not function yet.

As of now all types must not be dependent. In the future this might change by using some
more advanced haskell features
